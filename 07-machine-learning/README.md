## Overview

- The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## Statistics

- Mean [10, 20, **30**, 40, 50] - middle value of a sorted array is the mean.

- Mode [**3**, 10, 12, **3**, 8] - the most common number is the mode.

- Average [10, 34, 16, 8, 84] - the sum, divided by the amount is the average (**30.4**)

- Variance [13, 4, 30, 30, 38, 2, 35, 34] - the average of the squared differences from the mean (**702**)

- Standard Deviation [13, 4, 30, 30, 38, 2, 35, 34] - the square root of the Variance (**26.5**)

- Percentile - measure that indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations

- Correlation - measure how two variables move with respect to each other.

## Types of Machine Learning
